# Team

A mini credits roll to honor the visionaries behind The Gibsey Project and pave the way for future contributors.

## Founding Duo

### Brennan

*   **Role:** Technical Architect and Backend Maestro
*   **Contributions:** Driving the development of core backend services including FastAPI endpoints, Apache Cassandra data orchestration, and ensuring robust semantic search with HNSW indexing.
*   **Vision:** Brennan champions a system where technology empowers narrative recursion—a machine that not only stores pages but also resonates with human memory and imagination.

### Maggie Utley

*   **Role:** Creative Director and Frontend Designer
*   **Contributions:** Crafting the ancient-futurist aesthetic of the symbolic 5-column interface, curating the visual language of rotating SVG symbols, and ensuring that the UI encapsulates the spirit of reading, writing, remembering, and dreaming.
*   **Vision:** Maggie redefines interactivity as a co-authored narrative, where every gesture transforms screen elements into a dynamic tapestry of color, symbol, and story.

## Inspirations

The project draws inspiration from a blend of visionary ideas and diverse disciplines:

*   **Literary Recursion & Storytelling:** A recursive approach to narrative, where each page builds on the last and every saved thought is a chapter in a living book.
*   **Ancient-Futurist Aesthetics:** Merging digital scripture with symbolic poetry to create an interface that feels timeless and ever-evolving.
*   **AI as a Co-Author:** Embracing the idea that technology can augment human creativity, supporting a bi-directional dialogue between humans and artificial intelligence in storytelling.
*   **Symbolic Interactionism:** Utilizing a distinctive system of symbols (with 16 core glyphs in 4 orientations) that function as both aesthetic markers and semantic tags, guiding users in a meaningful dialogue with the system.

## Future Contributor Tracks

The horizon is broad and welcoming for new collaborators to build upon The Gibsey Project’s foundation. Future contribution tracks include:

*   **Software Engineers & Full-Stack Developers:** To enhance both the backend services (e.g., scaling multi-user concurrency, integrating Kafka/Faust pipelines) and dynamic frontend experiences.
*   **UI/UX Designers:** To refine and expand the ancient-futurist aesthetic into mobile and tablet interfaces, and to further develop symbolic visual language that balances clarity with artistic expression.
*   **Narrative Architects & Content Strategists:** To evolve the recursive storytelling mechanic, ensuring that the narrative layers—from The Entrance Way to the Gibsey Vault—remain engaging, intuitive, and deeply interwoven with user experience.
*   **AI Specialists & Data Scientists:** To drive innovation in AI co-authorship, enhance semantic search capabilities, and explore advanced integrations such as local LLM support with Ollama or decentralized storage with LibP2P/IPFS.
*   **Community Moderators & Contributors:** To shape the future of open-source contributions, ensuring that collaborative features are maintained with integrity, and to help scale user-generated content into a rich, shared narrative legacy.

The Gibsey Project is a living experiment—a recursive conversation between human creativity and artificial intelligence. The foundation laid by Brennan and Maggie is just the beginning. As we expand, each new contributor will help script the next chapter of this revolutionary journey.Team – The Gibsey Collective (v0.2)

## Constellation Note

“Gibsey is currently operated by two full‑time creators. This is not a team—it is a constellation.

We welcome any new stars who want to pass through Gibsey's gates (or entrance ways) in order to make the glyphs of our future.
