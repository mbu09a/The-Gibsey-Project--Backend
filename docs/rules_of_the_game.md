# Rules of the Game – Gibsey v0.2

*A living rulebook for a recursive theme‑park‑book‑OS.*

## 0. Overview

These rules define how **symbols, pages, Vault, QDPI, and characters** interlock.\
They supersede older drafts and align with the **fixed five‑column interface** and the **Up/Right/Down/Left orientation map**.

*   **16 base symbols** × **4 orientations** → **64 narrative states**.
*   Color is **immutable** per symbol; orientation changes state, *never hue*.
*   Every artefact (user query, AI dream, page quote) is a **Page**.
*   The **Vault** is the only editable canon.

## 1. The Corpus Is Sacred

Each symbol maps to a primary story arc **and** a matching character (MCP).\
The symbol rotates through four states:

|             |               |                           |              |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
|             |               |                           |              |
|             |               |                           |              |
| Orientation | Glyph (arrow) | State                     | Column       |
| **Up**      | ↑             | **Read** (immutable page) | Primary Left |
| **Right**   | →             | **Write** (user query)    | Panel Input  |
| **Down**    | ↓             | **Dream** (AI response)   | Panel Stream |
| **Left**    | ←             | **Remember** (saved page) | Vault        |

A symbol’s **hex color** never changes across states.

## 2. Pages Are Pages Are Pages

Every query, every response, every quote—**all pages**.\
Pages accrue orientation + symbol metadata and may be saved (Remember) or disappear (Dream unsaved, Write unsaved).

## 3. The Vault Is the Future

The Vault is the only mutable canon.\
What is saved becomes memory; what is unsaved dissolves into possibility.

## 4. QDPI Is the Heartbeat

A full **Quad‑Directional Protocol Interface** cycle:

1.  **Read** (Up) – select page → auto‑saves to Vault.
2.  **Write** (Right) – user query.
3.  **Dream** (Down) – AI stream.
4.  **Remember** (Left) – manual save.

Every heartbeat moves the narrative forward.

## 5. Characters Are Systems

Each MCP is a memory agent with tone and constraint.\
Chatting with an MCP writes **secondary pages** tagged by that character’s symbol + color.

## 6. Symbols Encode Meaning

Orientation, color, sequence = language.\
A Vault timeline is a chromatic sentence of lived recursion.

## 7. No Doors Are Closed

Pages cycle. Time loops. You can always return. You can never go back the same.

## 8. Reading Is Recursive

Reading spawns memory → memory spawns authorship → authorship becomes page.

## 9. The Interface Stays Still While You Move

The five‑column grid is fixed; narrative motion is symbolic, both non-spatial and spatial, at the same time. Subject and Object, Glyph Marrow style. 

## 10. Gibsey Is A Restartup

Not a product, nor a game—**a recursive memory archive disguised as a theme park disguised as a book.**

*And like all good parks—it never closes.*
