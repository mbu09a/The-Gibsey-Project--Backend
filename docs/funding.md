# Funding – The Gibsey Project

**A symbolic operating system for recursive storytelling needs funding to finish—not to scale.**

## 1. Current State

The Gibsey Project is entirely self-funded by its co-creators, **Brennan and Maggie Utley**. Together, they are building a prototype that fuses narrative recursion, symbolic interface design, and human-AI co-authorship into a new genre of operating system.

They are working full-time under extreme financial strain. There is no institutional backing, no revenue stream, and no monetization layer currently live. All code, design, and architecture to date has been built without funding.

## 2. Funding Objectives

*   **Survive:** Secure living support and stability to finish the MVP.
*   **Ship:** Fund remaining tasks for deployment of a secure, doc-aligned desktop prototype.
*   **Scale Carefully:** Prepare a foundation for future features, decentralized expansion, and multi-user rollout without compromising symbolic integrity.
