# Roadmap

This document is a living, kanbanâ€‘style roadmap that tracks completed, testing, backlog, and future features with target dates for The Gibsey Project.

## Overview

The Gibsey Project is an AI OS that blends human authorship and advanced AI to foster a new medium of recursive storytelling, symbolic interaction, and narrative co-authorship. This roadmap reflects our agile approach to building an immersive, desktop-first experience through iterative milestones and planned integrations.

Below is the current status of key milestones and features, organized into four columns:

### Completed

*   **Backend Endpoints Complete**

    *   *Description:* All key backend endpoints (e.g., `/pages`, `/search`, `/chat`, `/chat/stream`) have been implemented.
    *   *Target Date:* April 26, 2025

### Testing

*   **Symbolâ€‘Aware UI Beta**

    *   *Description:* Initial testing for the 5â€‘column symbolic interface and dynamic color themes is underway.
    *   *Target Date:* May 03, 2025

*   **Vault Storage & Timeline**

    *   *Description:* Validation of the automatic Vault timeline, where user interactions (Reads, Dreams, Remembers) are recorded and color-tagged.
    *   *Target Date:* May 10, 2025

### Backlog

*   **Security & Loadâ€‘Test Pass**

    *   *Description:* Ongoing improvements to security measures including RS256 JWT, rateâ€‘limiting, and comprehensive load testing. This phase will ensure robust performance and data integrity.
    *   *Target Date:* May 15, 2025

### Future Features

*   **MVP Soft Launch**

    *   *Description:* Final release of the desktopâ€‘only MVP, integrating all core functions of the Quadâ€‘Directional Protocol Interface (QDPI) cycleâ€”Read, Index, Write, and Generate.
    *   *Target Date:* May 17, 2025

*   **Postâ€‘MVP Integrations**

    *   Planned features include:

        *   Kafka + Faust for realâ€‘time symbolic state streaming
        *   Ollama for local LLM support
        *   Elasticsearch + Redis for realâ€‘time symbolic updates
        *   LibP2P/IPFS for decentralized Vault storage
        *   Alternative embedding solutions such as ChromaDB or Weaviate

## How to Use This Roadmap

*   **Dynamic Updates:** This document is updated regularly to reflect current progress on completed tasks, items in testing, backlog priorities, and future feature planning.
*   **Feedback Loop:** As with the QDPI cycle, every new milestone and retrospective drives iterative improvements to both the product and the roadmap itself.
*   **Kanban Style:** The roadmap is maintained in a kanban style to facilitate transparency and enable the team and stakeholders to track progress at a glance.

## Conclusion

This roadmap serves not only as a project management tool but also as a symbolic narrative of The Gibsey Projectâ€™s journey. As we move from a completed backend framework to an immersive, symbol-driven UI and full MVP launch, every milestone contributes to the transformation from tokenâ€‘metered scarcity to gifted AI abundance.

*Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to build, test, and refine the Gibsey experience.*Gibsey RoadmapÂ â€“Â v0.2Â Â Â *(RefactorÂ Sprint â†’ Privateâ€‘Alpha)*

**Timebox:**Â Aprilâ€¯2025â€¯â†’â€¯Juneâ€¯2025Â Â Â |Â Â Â **Northâ€‘Star:**Â Ship a stable, docâ€‘aligned desktop MVP (5â€‘column UI, semantic search, streaming chat, encrypted Vault) to a closed tester cohort.

## Overview

The roadmap is maintained kanbanâ€‘style and updated continuously by Cursor hooks (Â§Â ValidationÂ Matrix).\
It marries **technical milestones** (vector index latency, TLS, audit logs) with **symbolic goals** (colorâ€‘true UI, Vault ritual flow).\
Every checkbox is both a project task **and** a page in Gibseyâ€™s unfolding narrative.
